# Hi, I'm Arif 👋

AI/ML Engineer · Backend Developer · Data Engineer  
Building **production-grade** ML systems, RAG apps, and data platforms.

- 🔭 Currently working on: AI governance frameworks and ML-powered solutions at scale  
- 🧠 Experience: 4–5+ years across ML, backend (FastAPI), and data engineering  
- 🌏 Location: Dhaka, Bangladesh  
- 🌱 Learning: Advanced MLOps, LLM optimization, and AI governance practices  
- 🤝 Open to: Collaborating on ML systems, RAG pipelines, and infrastructure-heavy projects

## ⚙️ What I Do

- 🧮 **Machine Learning & LLMs**:  
  - Supervised/unsupervised ML, classic models to modern deep learning  
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), semantic search, and vector databases  
  - Responsible AI and AI governance design for real-world organizations  

- 🧵 **Backend & APIs**:  
  - FastAPI-based microservices and high-performance REST APIs  
  - Authentication, rate limiting, background jobs, and observability  
  - Clean architecture, modular design, and production-ready code practices  

- 📊 **Data Engineering & MLOps**:  
  - ETL/ELT pipelines, data modeling, and warehouse-oriented design  
  - CI/CD for ML, containerization with Docker, and cloud deployment  
  - Experiment tracking, model versioning, and monitoring in production

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python, SQL, Bash, JavaScript (frontend basics)  
- **ML / Data**: scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, PyTorch/TensorFlow (as needed), Hugging Face, vector DBs  
- **Backend**: FastAPI, REST APIs, async Python, JWT auth  
- **Data & Storage**: PostgreSQL, relational modeling, query optimization  
- **DevOps / Infra**: Docker, GitHub Actions, AWS / GCP  
- **Tools**: Git & GitHub, CLI, Postman/curl, VS Code, Jupyter

## 🚀 Selected Focus Areas

- 🧩 **Production ML Systems** – from notebook to robust, observable services  
- 📚 **RAG & Search** – domain-specific assistants with strong retrieval and ranking  
- 🛡️ **AI Governance** – policies, frameworks, and tooling for responsible AI adoption  
- 🧰 **MLOps** – making training, deployment, and monitoring repeatable and reliable

## 📂 What You’ll Find Here

- End-to-end ML projects with:
  - Clear READMEs, problem statements, and architecture overviews  
  - Reproducible environments (Docker, requirements, Makefiles or scripts)  
- Backend services built with FastAPI and strong API design  
- Data pipelines and utilities for ETL, feature engineering, and analytics  
- Experimentation with LLMs, vector search, and RAG patterns  

Pinned repos (recommended to pin):
- ✅ A production-style ML service (API + model + monitoring)  
- ✅ A RAG or LLM-powered application  
- ✅ A data engineering or ETL project  
- ✅ Any open-source contribution or template repo you want others to reuse
