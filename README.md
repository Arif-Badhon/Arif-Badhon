# Hi, I'm Arif 👋

**AI/ML Systems Engineer · Backend & Data Platform Builder**  
Designing **secure, production-grade** ML systems, RAG platforms, and data-intensive services.

- 🔭 **Current focus:** AI governance frameworks, enterprise AI agents, and ML systems at scale  
- 🧠 **Experience:** 4+ years across ML, backend (FastAPI), and data engineering / MLOps  
- 🌍 **Location:** Dhaka, Bangladesh — open to global & remote collaboration  
- 🧭 **Interest areas:** AI governance, RAG platforms, ML infra, and long-term impacts of AI

## ⚙️ What I Work On

**🧮 Machine Learning & LLMs**

- Supervised / unsupervised ML, classic models to modern deep learning  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), semantic search, vector databases  
- Generative AI (Llama 2, Gemma, AWS Bedrock) and evaluation / observability  
- Responsible AI and AI governance design for real-world organizations

**🧵 Backend & APIs**

- FastAPI-based microservices and high-performance REST APIs  
- Async Python, streaming responses, background jobs, task queues  
- Auth (JWT), rate limiting, observability, and clean modular architecture  
- Integration with databases, vector stores, and external ML services

**📊 Data Engineering & MLOps**

- ETL/ELT pipelines, data modeling, and analytics-ready warehouse design  
- CI/CD for ML, Docker-first workflows, cloud deployment (AWS/GCP)  
- Experiment tracking (MLflow / W&B / Neptune), model versioning  
- Production monitoring, logging, and feedback loops for ML services

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python, SQL, Bash, JavaScript (frontend basics)  
- **ML / Data:** scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, PyTorch / TensorFlow (as needed), Hugging Face, LangChain, vector DBs (Qdrant, PGVector)  
- **Backend:** FastAPI, REST APIs, async Python, JWT auth  
- **Data & Storage:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, relational modeling, query optimization  
- **MLOps / Infra:** Docker, Airflow, GitHub Actions / GitLab CI, AWS, GCP, MLflow, W&B, Neptune  
- **Analytics & BI:** Power BI, Tableau, Superset  
- **Tools:** Git & GitHub, CLI, Postman/curl, VS Code, Jupyter

## 🚀 Selected Focus Areas

- 🧩 **Production ML Systems** – taking models from notebooks to robust, observable services  
- 📚 **RAG & Search** – domain-specific assistants with strong retrieval, ranking, and evaluation  
- 🛡️ **AI Governance** – policies, frameworks, and tooling for secure, compliant, responsible AI adoption  
- 🧰 **MLOps** – making training, deployment, and monitoring repeatable, automated, and auditable

## 🔗 Live & Flagship Projects

> These are good candidates to **pin** on GitHub.

- **LLM Data Analyzer (Llama 2 + Streamlit + Docker)**  
  Streamlit-based app powered by a Dockerized Llama 2 model that provides conversational insights and statistical summaries from CSV/Excel datasets.  

- **RAG Observability Platform (Docker + MLOps)**  
  A Dockerized observability stack for RAG pipelines with real-time tracing, quality metrics, and evaluation hooks (ideal for production RAG systems).  

- **AI Incident Reporting Agent (NLP + RAG + PGVector)**  
  Enterprise incident reporting assistant that automates categorization and summarization of reports, reducing manual processing by ~90% in production settings.  

- **Privacy-First Enterprise RAG System (FastAPI + Qdrant)**  
  A domain-specific semantic search and question-answering system designed with data isolation and governance in mind, suitable for compliance-sensitive environments.  

- **MLOps Pipeline for CIFAR-10 (Docker + CI/CD)**  
  End-to-end image classification pipeline with experiment tracking and production-ready deployment flow, achieving 98% validation accuracy.  

- **ETL Pipeline with Airflow & Docker**  
  Orchestrated ETL that processes 100K+ records daily and reduces data refresh times from hours to minutes.

## 📂 What You'll Find in My Repos

- End-to-end ML projects with:
  - Clear READMEs, problem statements, and architecture diagrams/overviews  
  - Reproducible environments (Docker, requirements, Makefiles or helper scripts)  
  - CI/CD scaffolding and monitoring hooks where relevant  
- Backend services built with FastAPI and solid API design principles  
- Data pipelines and utilities for ETL, feature engineering, and analytics  
- Experiments with LLMs, vector search, and RAG patterns (incl. observability & evaluation)  
- Occasional open-source contributions and starter templates you can reuse in your own projects  

**Recommended pinned repos:**

- ✅ A production-style ML service (FastAPI API + model + monitoring/metrics)  
- ✅ A RAG or LLM-powered application (ideally with evaluation / observability)  
- ✅ A data engineering or ETL project (Airflow / Docker / SQL-heavy)  
- ✅ Any open-source contribution or reusable template (e.g., FastAPI + RAG boilerplate)

## 🧭 Beyond Code

- 📘 Deeply interested in AI governance, AI security, and how organizations adopt ML responsibly  
- 📝 Enjoy technical writing, documentation, and sharing implementation details & architecture choices  
- 🌌 Outside of work: reading cosmology and theoretical physics, and occasionally playing competitive chess
